# What is Kepler ? 

Kepler is a Cryptocurrency with focus on Privacy, Scalability, Fungibility and ease of use. Kepler was built based on Grin which is a fantastic MimbleWimble (MW) Blockchain platform. Kepler, is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, producing blocks every 60 seconds. 
Thanks to its Blockchain design, Kepler uses less disk space, less CPU, it is far more efficient, faster, safer and private than "traditional" blockchain types.

Kepler will be capable of being extended towards Confidential Assets (CA). These are a major part of the evolution of the Blockchain technology, this will allow to support multiple asset types on the same chain which, at the same time, will enable new use cases, multi-asset transactions which effect atomic exchanges.  

We are currently working on our whitepaper which includes confidential assets. These will be released in an upcoming update for Kepler.

Blockchain technology and MimbleWimble are perhaps the most exciting recent technological achievements in the Blockchain industry.
